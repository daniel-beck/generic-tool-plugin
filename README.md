# Generic Tool Plugin

## Introduction

This plugin provides a "Generic Tool" tool installation for use in Pipelines.

It's a lighter weight alternative to installing plugins like Ant, Groovy, etc. when all you need is the tool installation definition for use with the `tool` step.

## Getting started

The tool configuration can be found in _Manage Jenkins » Global Tool Configuration » Generic Tool_.

The tool installations configured there can be used with the `tool` step in Pipelines.
